## Short info

A continuation of a school project I did last fall.

You fetch movies from an external api and add them to your list. You can also then score the movies and add a comment if you want to. User access control is done with fauna.

Data lives in faunadb and is fetched from there in `/pages/api`, all the fauna stuff is in `/fauna`.

The different pages are in `/pages`, with the main page being in `/pages/list`.

Made with responsive design in mind.
